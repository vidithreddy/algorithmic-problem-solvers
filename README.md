# Algorithmic Problem Solvers (algorithmic-problem-solvers)

## Purpose and Motivation
This repository contains simple, well-documented Python scripts demonstrating core problem-solving skills. Each utility solves a common programming challenge in a clean, modular, and professional style. The goal is to show strong fundamentals in Python, clear communication through code, and reusable design patterns for small algorithmic tasks.

## Features Demonstrated
- String parsing and tokenization
- Counting item occurrences with dictionaries
- Clean, idiomatic Python code
- Professional module-level and function-level docstrings
- Clear, reproducible example usage

### String Parser (string_parser.py)
Parses a sample comma-separated string into cleaned tokens.

### Item Counter (item_counter.py)
Counts and displays frequency of items in a sample list.

## Real-World Use Cases
These utilities demonstrate classic, real-world programming tasks:
- Parsing structured text input
- Summarizing and counting data
- Building utility scripts for data cleaning and preparation
